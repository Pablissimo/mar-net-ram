# Multi-Environment Testing Example

This repository is meant to accompany the article [Testing in Browsers and
Node with Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and Testem][1].

## Setting up

Clone this repository and run `npm install` in the root directory. You can
optionally run `npm install -g testem` and `npm install -g mocha` if you want
to use those modules globally rather than locally.

## Running

Running `npm test` in the root directory will run the tests. If you installed
[Testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) globally, you can also simply
run `testem` in the root directory to run the tests.
